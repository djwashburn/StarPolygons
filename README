This project draws a star polygon of an arbitrary Schlafli symbol 
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_polygon), including composite stars such as the 
star with symbol {6/2} or 2{3}, commonly known as the Star of David or hexagram. It
requires pygame in its current implementation, and in future iterations (if/when I 
get around to them) should be able to draw to a wxPython screen with GUI interaction
instead, and perhaps other types of canvas as well.
